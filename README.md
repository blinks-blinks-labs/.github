## Solana Blink-Action Protocol

Welcome to the GitHub organization for research Solana Blink-Action protocol. This organization aims to explore and enhance the Blink-Action protocol, which is currently in its early stages. 


As of now, the protocol is functional with a whitelist and a limited number of integrated wallets. However, there are significant areas for improvement:

1. **Security Enhancement**: We plan to introduce robust security checks to prevent injection attacks and vulnerabilities.
   
2. **Privacy Enhancement**: By incorporating zero-knowledge (zk) techniques, we aim to conceal transaction processes and token movements.
   
3. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implementing enhanced protocol monitoring will allow us to track user actions and detect malicious behavior effectively.
   
4. **Intent Detection**: We aspire to integrate AI capabilities to detect user intents and facilitate automated transactions through intelligent agents.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Protocol Exploration and Experimentation
- Research and brainstorm ideas for enhancing the Blink-Action protocol.
- Conduct initial experiments using browser plugins.

### Phase 2: Demonstration and Grant Application
- Develop a wallet demo integrating proposed security and privacy enhancements.
- Prepare demos for submission to the official grant application process.

## Team Members

- **Yu Jian**ï¼Œ**skyh**: Research lead
- **Xiao Long**: Technical expert
- **Amagi**: Protocol specialist

## Action Items

- **Yanbo**: Gather existing applications and information related to Blink.
- **Jinli**: Participate in mechanism research and implementation efforts.

## Next Steps

Our initial approach involves developing a Chrome extension using Plasmo or scripting with Greasemonkey to simulate vulnerability injections and validate actions.

Stay tuned for further updates as we progress with these initiatives.
